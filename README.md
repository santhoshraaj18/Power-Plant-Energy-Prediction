CCPP Energy Output Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the power output (PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) based on various environmental and operational factors. The dataset used includes attributes like ambient temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed, and aims to predict the plant's energy output.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build predictive models to estimate the power output (PE) using machine learning algorithms, specifically:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model to predict continuous values.
Random Forest Regressor: A more advanced ensemble method based on decision trees.
Steps involved in the project:
Data Exploration and Visualization: Understand the dataset and its relationships.
Model Training: Train Linear Regression and Random Forest models on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate both models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
Model Comparison: Compare both models' performance and select the best-performing model.
Visualization: Visualize predictions vs actual power output.
Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and consists of the following columns:

AT: Ambient Temperature (in Celsius)
V: Exhaust Vacuum (in mmHg)
AP: Ambient Pressure (in atm)
RH: Relative Humidity (in %)
PE: Power Output (in MW) - This is the target variable.

Results
Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models are trained and evaluated.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² Score are used as evaluation metrics.
The Random Forest Regressor model provides a better performance based on RMSE and R².
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting power output from a Combined Cycle Power Plant based on environmental and operational parameters. Among the models tested, Random Forest Regressor showed better performance compared to Linear Regression.
